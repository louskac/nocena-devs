# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Developer Task Tracker is a simple kanban-style project management tool designed specifically for development teams. It provides a Trello-like interface where tasks can be organized in columns representing different developers and a backlog. The system includes a bounty/points system to gamify task completion and a leaderboard to track developer contributions. All data is stored locally in JSON files without requiring a database.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to create and manage tasks with bounties, so that I can organize work and incentivize completion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the "Add Task" button THEN the system SHALL display a form with fields for task name, description, and points awarded
2. WHEN I submit a valid task form THEN the system SHALL create a new task in the backlog column
3. WHEN I create a task THEN the system SHALL assign it a unique identifier and timestamp
4. IF any required field is empty THEN the system SHALL display validation errors and prevent submission

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to drag tasks from the backlog to my column, so that I can claim ownership of tasks I want to work on.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I drag a task from the backlog column THEN the system SHALL allow me to drop it in any developer column
2. WHEN I drop a task in a developer column THEN the system SHALL assign that task to the respective developer
3. WHEN a task is moved between columns THEN the system SHALL update the task status and save changes to the JSON file
4. WHEN I drag a task THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback during the drag operation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to mark tasks as complete with completion details, so that I can track my work and get credit for completed tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I complete a task THEN the system SHALL allow me to add estimated hours spent, git commit reference, and completion comments
2. WHEN I submit completion details THEN the system SHALL move the task to a completed state and award points to my total
3. WHEN I complete a task THEN the system SHALL timestamp the completion and preserve all task history
4. IF I try to complete a task without required completion fields THEN the system SHALL display validation errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to view a leaderboard showing developer contributions, so that I can see who has contributed most to the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the application THEN the system SHALL display a leaderboard showing each developer's total points earned
2. WHEN a task is completed THEN the system SHALL automatically update the leaderboard with the awarded points
3. WHEN displaying the leaderboard THEN the system SHALL sort developers by total points in descending order
4. WHEN showing developer stats THEN the system SHALL include total points, completed tasks count, and total hours worked

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to persist data locally, so that my tasks and progress are saved between sessions without requiring a database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create, update, or complete tasks THEN the system SHALL save all changes to a local JSON file
2. WHEN I reload the application THEN the system SHALL restore all tasks, assignments, and completion data from the JSON file
3. WHEN the JSON file doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it with default empty structure
4. IF there's an error reading the JSON file THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully and initialize with empty data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive kanban board interface, so that I can easily manage tasks across different developer columns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the application THEN the system SHALL display columns for backlog and each developer
2. WHEN displaying tasks THEN the system SHALL show task name, description, points, and current status
3. WHEN viewing developer columns THEN the system SHALL display the developer name and their current task count
4. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL be responsive and work well on different screen sizes
