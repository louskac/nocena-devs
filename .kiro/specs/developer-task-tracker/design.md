# Design Document

## Overview

The Developer Task Tracker is a client-side Next.js application that provides a kanban-style interface for managing development tasks with a bounty system. The application uses React's built-in state management with local JSON file persistence, drag-and-drop functionality, and a responsive Tailwind CSS interface.

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 15.5.2 with React 19.1.0
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.17
- **Language**: TypeScript 5
- **Data Persistence**: Local JSON file storage
- **Drag & Drop**: HTML5 Drag and Drop API with React event handlers

## Components and Interfaces

### Core Data Models

```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  points: number;
  status: 'backlog' | 'assigned' | 'completed';
  assignedTo?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  completedAt?: Date;
  completionDetails?: {
    hoursSpent: number;
    gitCommit: string;
    comments: string;
  };
}

interface Developer {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  totalPoints: number;
  completedTasks: number;
  totalHours: number;
}

interface AppState {
  tasks: Task[];
  developers: Developer[];
}
```

### Component Hierarchy

#### KanbanBoard (Main Container)
- Manages global application state
- Handles drag and drop operations
- Coordinates data persistence
- Renders TaskColumn components and Leaderboard

#### TaskColumn
- Represents a single column (backlog or developer)
- Handles drop events for task assignment
- Renders TaskCard components
- Shows column header with developer info

#### TaskCard
- Displays individual task information
- Handles drag events
- Provides completion action for assigned tasks
- Shows task status and points

#### AddTaskModal
- Form for creating new tasks
- Validates input fields
- Adds tasks to backlog

#### CompleteTaskModal
- Form for task completion details
- Captures hours, git commit, and comments
- Updates task status and developer stats

#### Leaderboard
- Displays developer rankings
- Shows points, completed tasks, and hours
- Updates automatically when tasks are completed

## Data Models

### JSON File Structure
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "task-1",
      "name": "Implement user authentication",
      "description": "Add login/logout functionality",
      "points": 50,
      "status": "completed",
      "assignedTo": "dev-1",
      "createdAt": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
      "completedAt": "2025-01-16T15:30:00Z",
      "completionDetails": {
        "hoursSpent": 8,
        "gitCommit": "abc123def",
        "comments": "Implemented OAuth integration"
      }
    }
  ],
  "developers": [
    {
      "id": "dev-1",
      "name": "Alice Johnson",
      "totalPoints": 150,
      "completedTasks": 3,
      "totalHours": 24
    }
  ]
}
```

### State Management
- Use React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for local state
- Implement custom hooks for data operations (`useTaskStorage`, `useDragAndDrop`)
- Debounce JSON file writes to prevent excessive I/O operations

## Error Handling

### File System Operations
- Graceful handling of missing JSON file (create with defaults)
- Error recovery for corrupted JSON data
- Fallback to empty state if file operations fail
- User notifications for persistence errors

### Drag and Drop
- Validate drop targets to prevent invalid operations
- Handle edge cases like dropping on same column
- Provide visual feedback for valid/invalid drop zones
- Revert state on failed operations

### Form Validation
- Required field validation for task creation
- Numeric validation for points and hours
- Git commit format validation (basic regex)
- Real-time validation feedback

### Data Integrity
- Prevent duplicate task IDs
- Ensure developer references are valid
- Validate task state transitions
- Handle concurrent modifications gracefully

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test individual components with React Testing Library
- Mock file system operations for storage tests
- Test drag and drop event handlers
- Validate form submission logic

### Integration Testing
- Test complete task lifecycle (create → assign → complete)
- Verify data persistence across component updates
- Test leaderboard calculations with various scenarios
- Validate responsive design on different screen sizes

### User Acceptance Testing
- Manual testing of drag and drop functionality
- Verify task creation and completion workflows
- Test data persistence across browser sessions
- Validate leaderboard accuracy with multiple developers

### Performance Testing
- Test with large numbers of tasks (100+ tasks)
- Verify smooth drag and drop performance
- Monitor JSON file size and read/write performance
- Test responsive design on mobile devices

## Implementation Notes

### Drag and Drop Implementation
- Use HTML5 Drag and Drop API with React synthetic events
- Implement custom drag preview for better UX
- Add visual indicators for valid drop zones
- Handle touch events for mobile compatibility

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- Horizontal scrolling for columns on small screens
- Collapsible leaderboard on mobile
- Touch-friendly drag and drop interactions

### Data Persistence
- Implement debounced writes to prevent excessive file operations
- Use atomic writes to prevent data corruption
- Add data migration logic for future schema changes
- Implement backup/restore functionality

### Developer Experience
- Clear TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Comprehensive error messages and logging
- Hot reload support for development
- ESLint configuration for code quality
