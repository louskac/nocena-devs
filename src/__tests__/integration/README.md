# Comprehensive Integration Tests

This directory contains comprehensive integration tests for the Developer Task Tracker application, covering all major workflows and requirements specified in task 10.

## Test Coverage

### 1. End-to-End Task Lifecycle Workflows

**File:** `task-lifecycle-integration.test.ts`

Tests complete task workflows from creation through completion:

- **Task Creation → Assignment → Completion**: Tests the full lifecycle of a task including developer auto-creation and stats updates
- **Multiple Tasks Across Developers**: Verifies proper state management with multiple tasks assigned to different developers
- **Developer Statistics Accuracy**: Ensures points, completed tasks, and hours are calculated correctly

### 2. Data Persistence and Recovery Across Browser Sessions

Tests localStorage functionality and data integrity:

- **Session Persistence**: Verifies tasks and developers persist across browser sessions
- **Complex Data Persistence**: Tests assignment and completion data persistence with full lifecycle
- **Corrupted Data Recovery**: Tests graceful handling of corrupted localStorage data
- **Rapid Operations Consistency**: Ensures data consistency during concurrent operations

### 3. Leaderboard Accuracy with Multiple Developers and Tasks

Tests leaderboard calculations and real-time updates:

- **Complex Ranking Scenarios**: Tests accurate ranking with multiple developers and varying point totals
- **Dynamic Ranking Updates**: Verifies leaderboard updates when new tasks are completed
- **Statistical Accuracy**: Ensures total points, completed tasks, and hours are calculated correctly

### 4. Drag and Drop Functionality Across Different Scenarios

Tests task movement between different states:

- **Backlog to Developer Assignment**: Simulates drag and drop from backlog to developer columns
- **Developer Reassignment**: Tests moving tasks between different developers
- **State Transitions**: Verifies proper status updates during task movement

### 5. Error Handling and Edge Cases

Tests application resilience:

- **Empty State Handling**: Ensures graceful behavior with no tasks or developers
- **localStorage Quota Exceeded**: Tests handling of storage limitations
- **Completed Task Protection**: Verifies completed tasks maintain data integrity
- **Large Dataset Performance**: Tests performance with 100+ tasks and multiple developers

## Test Files

### Primary Integration Tests

1. **`task-lifecycle-integration.test.ts`** - Core integration tests using the actual useTaskStorage hook
   - Tests real data persistence and state management
   - Covers all major workflows without UI complexity
   - Uses renderHook for focused testing of business logic

2. **`comprehensive-integration.test.tsx`** - UI-focused integration tests
   - Tests KanbanBoard component with mocked child components
   - Covers responsive design and user interaction scenarios
   - Handles complex UI state management

3. **`end-to-end-workflows.test.tsx`** - Alternative UI integration approach
   - Simplified UI testing without responsive design complexity
   - Focuses on component integration and user workflows

## Key Testing Patterns

### Mock Strategy
- **localStorage Mock**: Custom implementation for testing data persistence
- **Component Mocking**: Strategic mocking of child components to focus on integration logic
- **Hook Testing**: Direct testing of useTaskStorage hook for business logic validation

### Test Data Management
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Tests use realistic task and developer data
- **Edge Cases**: Includes boundary conditions and error scenarios  
- **Performance Testing**: Large dataset scenarios (100+ tasks, 10+ developers)

### Assertions
- **Data Integrity**: Verifies task and developer data remains consistent
- **State Transitions**: Ensures proper status updates during workflows
- **Error Recovery**: Tests graceful handling of various error conditions

## Requirements Coverage

The integration tests cover all requirements specified in task 10:

✅ **Create end-to-end tests for complete task lifecycle workflows**
- Task creation, assignment, and completion workflows
- Multiple developer scenarios with proper state management

✅ **Test drag and drop functionality across different scenarios**  
- Task movement between backlog and developer columns
- Developer reassignment and state transitions

✅ **Verify data persistence and recovery across browser sessions**

✅ **Test leaderboard accuracy with multiple developers and tasks**
- Complex ranking scenarios with multiple developers
- Real-time updates when tasks are completed
- Statistical accuracy for points, tasks, and hours

✅ **Requirements Coverage: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1**
- All specified requirements are covered through comprehensive test scenarios

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all integration tests
npm test -- --testPathPatterns="integration"

# Run specific integration test file
npm test -- --testPathPatterns="task-lifecycle-integration.test.ts"

# Run with verbose output
npm test -- --testPathPatterns="integration" --verbose
```
